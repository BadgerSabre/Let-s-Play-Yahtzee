## How to Play?
There is a "How to Play" button that will give the following instructions:

    You can click the "Roll Again" button to re roll any dice not in your hand up to two times, for a total of three rolls.
    To score points click on any row in the "Player Score" column of the score card.
    Click the "Play Again" button reset your score card and start a new game.

## Credits
This was a solo project by Brandon Dega https://github.com/BadgerSabre. However, I did recieve input on the fullhouse detection logic from https://github.com/rasnerk and help with the toggle music from https://github.com/ValerieFH.  I also want to give credit to my instructors for both guidance and styling input https://github.com/naaltunian and https://github.com/avawing.
